# Mashups-API

** These are the series of the projects about Mashup APIs**

1. Self++++olitics : Selfie + Politics News

Users can check politics news with Selfies. 
I think the instinct of self-expression can be related to the willingness of participating in Politics. 
That's why I made <a href="http://jiwonyoonworks.com/web/selfolitics.html" target="_blank">this mashup website</a> "Self++++olitics" which looks like news magazine. 
I used Instagram API and USA Today API. Users can put the keywords which is related to Politics. 
If users put bad keywords, users will receive alert!
